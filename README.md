# SolarKeeper

A project created by Ground Light, Lda. with the colaboration of Tiago Adri√£o.

This project was planned to give free information and awareness of the dangers of UV-A and UV-B exposure.

With this, we want to implement this information on every beach with informations about the realtime UV-B index and other informations like air temperature, tides, beach quality, etc.

With this we'll improve the UV-B index reading that are made nowadays via satellite.

This project have been prototiped with the support of a Arduino Wifi Rev.2 which reads and comunicates with a Raspberry 3B running Raspian and show the received information via a python-based GUI.
